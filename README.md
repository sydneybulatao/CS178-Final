# Message Board and Emergency Call Visual Analytics System
Dashboard built using Python, Flask, JavaScript, D3, HTML, and CSS to visualize and analyze message and emergency call center data. 

Includes visuals of message frequencies, emergency call geo-location maps, an AI-generated summary of messages, and the ability to filter the dashboard through various specifications. This dashboard helped us solve [2021 VAST mini challenge #3](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2021/).
